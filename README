This repository contains key scripts used to generate the results in our paper: https://nn.neurology.org/content/8/4/e1007

The autosomal genetic risk score was created by running the following (in order):
1. ms_prs_stage1.sh (or ms_prs_stage1_mhc.sh for the MHC score)
2. ms_prs_stage2.sh
3. ms_prs_stage3.sh
4. ms_prs_stage4.sh
5. ms_prs_stage5.r

The script ukb_convert_pheno_stage3.r was used to define disease variables from ICD codes and self-report, and to define HLA alleles from impute HLA data.

Details of the main analyses in the paper are in ukb_case_control_16_02.r.
