This repository contains key scripts used to generate the results in our paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.971739v1.full

The autosomal genetic risk score was created by running the following (in order):
1. make_ms_prs_stage1.sh
2. make_ms_prs_stage2.sh
3. make_ms_prs_stage3.sh
4. make_ms_prs_stage4.sh
5. make_ms_prs_stage5.sh

The script ukb_convert_pheno_stage3.r was used to define disease variables from ICD codes and self-report, and to define HLA alleles from impute HLA data.

Details of the main analyses in the paper are in ukb_case_control.r.

Details of interaction analyses (Attributable Proportion due to interaction) are in bmi.r, menarche.r, prs.r, and smoking.r.
